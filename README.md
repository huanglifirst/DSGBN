# DSGBN (Dual Stream Network Based on GCN and BiLSTM for Photovoltaic Power Forecasting)

## Project Overview

This project is an implementation of the paper "Dual Stream Network Based on GCN and BiLSTM for Photovoltaic Power Forecasting," which aims to improve photovoltaic power forecasting accuracy by combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (BiLSTM). The proposed dual-stream network structure captures both spatial dependencies through GCN and temporal dependencies through BiLSTM, effectively enhancing forecasting performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this implementation can be downloaded from the following link: [DKA Solar Centre Alice Springs Dataset](https://dkasolarcentre.com.au/locations/alice-springs/graphs?sources=93)

## Full Code

The complete code will be uploaded after the paper is published.
